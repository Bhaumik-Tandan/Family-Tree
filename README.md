# Family Tree CLI

This is a command-line tool for managing family relationships.

## Installation

To install the Family Tree CLI, use the following command:

```sh
pip install .

If you're using Python 3, you might need to use pip3 instead of pip:

pip3 install .


Adding Current Path to PATH Variable (Mac)
If you're using Mac, you can add the current path to the PATH variable using the following command:


export PATH=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.11/bin:$PATH
This ensures that you can execute the family-tree command from any directory without specifying the full path.
